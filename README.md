# Advanced_ML_DL_Course_Assignment_2

**By: Raz Graider, Sophie Margolis, Ran Asanta and Dana Braynin**

In this project, we were given a dataset containing the scripts of all Seinfeld and Friends episodes.
We were asked to create a deep learning model that could identify whether a line was taken from a Seinfeld episode or from a Friends episode.
This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task. We were given 70,405 observations. We analyzed the given data, processed it and classified the samples in the test data.

We achieved a test score of 86.2191% using Keras Neural Network.

**This project was done as an assignment in the Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning course at Tel Aviv University.**
